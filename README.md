## 🚀 Features

### 1- Location-based Services
- Detects user location to connect them with companies covering their specific zone (e.g., Cairo, Giza).
- Allows pinning exact addresses on the map for accurate service delivery.
- **Why it matters:** ensures logistical feasibility and reduces "out of coverage" cancellations.

---

### 2- Distinct User Roles

- **Service Companies:** Manage service portfolio, view incoming request queues, and publish hot offers.
- **Why it matters:** tailored dashboards that streamline the workflow for both demand and supply sides.

---

### 3- Smart Request System (Dynamic Forms)
- Context-aware forms that change based on the service (e.g., asking for "AC Horsepower" vs. "Number of Rooms").
- Allows clients to upload photos/media of the issue during the request.
- **Why it matters:** eliminates ambiguity and ensures the company arrives prepared with the right tools.

---

### 4- Company Dashboard & Offers
- **Request Management:** A Kanban-style view for companies to Accept, Reject, or Schedule incoming orders.

### 5- Real-time Order Tracking
